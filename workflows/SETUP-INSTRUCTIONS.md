If you get an error about the webhook path already existing:
1. Check your existing workflows
2. Either delete the old one or change the path in the webhook node

### Import Errors
If the import fails:
1. Make sure you're using a recent version of n8n
2. Try copying the JSON content and pasting it in the workflow editor

### Credentials Error (OpenAI workflow)

2. Check that the API key has sufficient credits
3. Verify the API key permissions
